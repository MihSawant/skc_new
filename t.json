The transmitter is connected to a live\/non-live floating system of up to 300V DC preferably on the DC bus. It then transmits low frequencies and low voltage signals in the DC system without affecting the sensitive operation of relays. The transmitted signal is then tracked by the receiver to locate the faulted feeder and tracks it up to the point of fault.
